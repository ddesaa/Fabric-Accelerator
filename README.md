# Fabric Accelerator

## Description
 

Fabric Accelerator is a solution developed in Microsoft Fabric that enables the rapid and simple implementation of the first phase of a medallion data architecture. Its main goal is to accelerate the start of data engineering projects through a set of guided configurations that automate ingestion and the creation of the Bronze layer.

## Key Benefits
 

- **Speed**: with just a few configuration steps, a standardized ingestion flow is enabled.

- **Simplicity**: no complex development required, based on parameterization and best practices.

- **Standardization**: ensures consistency in the Bronze layer for any data source.

- **Scalability**: designed to extend into Silver and Gold layers, following the medallion architecture.

## Functional Scope

- Data ingestion from multiple sources supported by Fabric.

- Automated writing into the Bronze layer (Delta format).

- Flexible configuration through metadata.

- Foundation for applying data quality and governance controls from the early stages.

## Value for the Organization

With Fabric Accelerator, organizations can launch their data platform in Fabric immediately, reducing the startup time from weeks to hours, while ensuring that the initial design follows modern cloud data engineering standards.

 

## Multiplatform

Although it originates in Microsoft Fabric, the concept can also be applied to other modern data platforms such as Azure Synapse Analytics or Databricks, since it is based on patterns and architectural practices rather than specific technical dependencies.

 

# Technical Solution
In this version of a Fabric Accelerator solution, we aimed to adapt bennyaustin’s proposal to the integration solutions previously applied, taking the most suitable elements from both approaches based on our experience.

## Objective

This solution implements a data ingestion and processing flow in Microsoft Fabric, orchestrated by a metadata-driven system to dynamically execute notebooks.

The goal is to integrate data from multiple sources into a Medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold), optimizing reusability and minimizing maintenance.

## High-Level Architecture

### Medallion Architecture

- **Bronze (Landing/Raw)**: Data ingested from sources without transformation.

- **Silver (Curated)**: Cleansing, validations, and normalization.

- **Gold (Business)**: Data ready for analysis and consumption.

## Metadata-Based Configuration and Orchestration

### Metadata-Driven Approach
Fabric Accelerator is built on a metadata-driven orchestration model, which means that ingestion processes and the construction of the Bronze layer are not rigidly hard-coded, but instead are dynamically configured based on information stored in a central database.

### Implementation

- Metadata is managed in an Azure SQL Database instance, which serves as the single configuration repository.

- Each data source, set of tables, or ingestion process is defined through metadata entries (e.g., source paths, load frequencies, partitioning rules, formats, Bronze layer destinations).

- The Fabric pipeline reads this metadata and dynamically executes the required steps without the need to rewrite code.

### Advantages of this Approach

- Scalability and flexibility: adding a new data source only requires registering its metadata, without developing new pipelines.

- Standardization: all processes follow the same orchestration rules, preventing inconsistencies across implementations.

- Data governance: metadata becomes a controlled and auditable asset, supporting traceability and quality.

- Reusability: the same framework can be applied across environments (Fabric, Synapse, Databricks), since the logic is decoupled from the execution engine.

## Strategic Importance of Metadata

Metadata is no longer just an auxiliary element—it becomes the core of the architecture:

- Defines what data is ingested, how, and how often.

- Centralizes business and technical rules for pipelines.

- Ensures that changes in the data ecosystem are managed quickly and safely, without manual code intervention.

In summary, metadata not only orchestrates the process but also transforms the architecture into a governed, dynamic, and sustainable system.
